ABOUT PIXEL PUSHER
------------------

Pixel Pusher integrates with Pixel Ping, the Node.js pixel-tracking service from 
Pro Publica and DocumentCloud:

http://documentcloud.github.com/pixel-ping/
http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/pixel-ping-a-nodejs-stats-tracker

The point of the module is to receive and process information from Pixel Ping so
that Drupal can accurately track node statistics via the node_counter table.
This enables a site to operate behind layers of external cache but still have
accurate information for determining, e.g., most popular content.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module runs in Drupal or Pressflow 6.x.  To run Pixel Ping, you'll need 
Node.js and the Node Package Manager (npm) installed:

http://nodejs.org/
http://github.com/isaacs/npm


INSTALLATION
------------

Install the Drupal module as you normally would:

* Unpack the pixel_pusher archive into your modules folder, typically at
  sites/all/modules.

* Enable the module using Drush or in your browser at admin/build/modules.

* Pixel Pusher provides an admin page at admin/settings/pixel_pusher where you must
  specify the server location of Pixel Ping.  Set this to reflect the "host" and 
  "port" settings in Pixel Ping's config.json file (see below, "Running Pixel Ping").

* Use the blocks administration page at admin/build/block to add the Pixel Pusher block
  to your public theme.  This would typically go in a footer region.


RUNNING PIXEL PING
------------------

Pixel Ping is easy to install and run:

pixel-ping path/to/config.json

A sample config file is shipped with this module as sample-config.json.  You'll see that this config
has the server running here:

http://127.0.0.1:9187

You should set the "Pixel Ping server" value on the Pixel Pusher settings page to this URL.

If you run Pixel Ping in a shell, you'll see a message like this as a confirmation that the service
has started:

Flushing hits to http://example.com/pixel_pusher/save_hits

When a browser requests a page containing this pixel, Pixel Pusher will report back to stdout:

1:	node,5276
--- flushed ---

The number after the comma is the NID of the node that's been hit.  You'll see a "--- flushed ---" 
when Pixel Ping flushes its data according to the time you set in config.json.


MODULE STATUS
-------------

The next version of this module will include a second pixel block, this one served by Drupal itself.
The pixel will cause Drupal to increment the node_counter stats.  The logic for this will be adapted
from the excellent Boost module (http://drupal.org/project/boost), to whose developer I am 
extremely grateful.
